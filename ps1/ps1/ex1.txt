1. What is the host name of the computer as reported by your linux environment? 
(You will need to find the right Linux command to execute for this. I suggest searching the web.)

I used $ echo $HOSTNAME to get: 
Bens-MacBook-Pro.local

2. How would you specify the name of an output file when you use the compiler if 
you wanted the executable to have a name other than a.out?

c++ -o alternative_name hello.cpp
(notice this works even without the .out extension name)

3. What happens if you type
$ a.out
instead of
$ ./a.out
to run your program? What is the difference (operationally) between the two statements?

If you type "a.out", it thinks you mean a command, and so bash responds: 
bash: a.out: command not found
However, if you type "./a.out", then the "." means the current directory, 
and the "/a.out" is the path to the file in the directory, so it knows you want to
run the file a.out, which is indeed what we want. 

4. What does clang print when you run
$ c++ --version

Apple clang version 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.29)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin20.3.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin

5. In the example program, the i and N variables are said to be size_t. What is a size_t?

An unsigned integral data type, the result of the sizeof operator. 
So size_t N = 1024 gives an unsigned integer type big enough to fit 1024. 
Can be as big as the host system can handle, so is useful for portability.
